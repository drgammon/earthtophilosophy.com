# About Us

Earth To Philosophy is a conversation-based podcast featuring philosophers working on nature and the environment. Each episode, hosts Claire Hamlett and Andrea Gammon speak with a guest and discuss some of their work, usually a recent book or paper, or perhaps a side project they have going. We're not aiming for the podcast to be an exhaustive representation of the field, but instead is more of an excuse for us to talk with people whose work we find interesting and to bring environmental philosophy to a wider audience through these conversations.
